# This workflow is useful if you need to make a new release manually for testing purposes.
#
# This uploads the zip release bundle to `transfer.sh`. Where it will remain for 14 days.
# NOTE: This file can be overwritten so be cautious when downloading.
# The idea behind this process is to avoid publishing a test version to our Github Release page.
